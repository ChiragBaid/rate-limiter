Environment (example):
- Local dev machine: Intel i7-9750H, 16GB RAM, SSD
- Go runtime: go1.21
- Vegeta (example) used to simulate load

Key results (sample):
- In-Memory backend: peak RPS = 9200 req/s, p50 ≈ 11 ms, p95 ≈ 48 ms, error < 0.1%
- Redis backend: peak RPS = 2800 req/s, p50 ≈ 18 ms, p95 ≈ 70 ms, error ≈ 0.5% at peak
